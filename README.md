<h1 align="center"> ustvgo_to_m3u </h1>
This has been moded slightly to store the m3u file in local dir. The original script can be found at 
https://github.com/benmoose39/ustvgo_to_m3u

Grabs m3u links from ustvgo.tv

**NEW UPDATE: If you hate setting up cron jobs, just execute `server.py` (based on Flask, yes it's a webserver) and leave it running.**

### Steps to run `server.py`:
> Have flask installed: `pip install flask`

> Edit the script to add your server device's IP (change the port too, if you wish)

> Assuming port 9000, if your server device's IP is 10.10.10.10, playlist url would be: http://10.10.10.10:9000/ustvgo.m3u

### Usage (The raw script, requires you to set up a cron job every 4 hours)

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/benmoose39/ustvgo_to_m3u.git
cd ustvgo_to_m3u
```
##### To run manually:
```
chmod +x autorun.sh
./autorun.sh
```

##### To run automatically every 3 hours:
```
python3 autoCRON.py
```
